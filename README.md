# Prototypes

[![Wolfram Language](https://wolfr.am/NyiJ4BVJ)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/)

A wide collection of functions which extend the Wolfram Language.

Install with the following command (replace 0.0.0 with the [latest version digits](https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes/releases)):

```wolframlanguage
PacletInstall["https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes/releases/download/v0.0.0/Prototypes-0.0.0.paclet"]
```

Alternatively you can install the latest version with:

```wolframlanguage
Needs["MPM`"]

MPMInstall[
 "arnoudbuzing",
 "Prototypes",
 "AllowPrereleases" -> True
 ]
```

A prerequisite for this method is the installation of this utility:
